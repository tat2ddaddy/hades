                    This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected,

                <div style={style.paragraph2}>
                    When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information
                    about your device, including
                    information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are
                    installed on
                    your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web
                    pages
                    or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information
                    about
                    how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device
                    Information”.
                </div>

                <div style={style.paragraph2}>
                    We collect Device Information using the following technologies:
                    - “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous
                    unique identifier. For more information about cookies, and how to disable cookies, visit
                    http://www.allaboutcookies.org.
                    - “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP address,
                    browser
                    type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time stamps.
                    - “Web beacons”, “tags”, and “pixels” are electronic files used to record information about how you
                    browse the Site.

                <div style={style.paragraph2}>
                    Additionally when you make a purchase or attempt to make a purchase
                    through the Site, we collect
                    certain
                    information from you, including your name, billing address, shipping address, payment information
                    (including credit card numbers), email address, and phone number. We refer to this information as
                    “Order
                    Information”

                    When we talk about “Personal Information” in this Privacy Policy, we are talking both about Device
                    Information and Order Information.

                <div style={style.subtitle}>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</div>
                <div style={style.paragraph2}>
                    We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any
                    orders placed through the Site
                    (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with
                    invoices
                    and/or order confirmations). Additionally, we use this Order Information to:
                    - Communicate with you;
                    - Screen our orders for potential risk or fraud; and
                    - When in line with the preferences you have shared with us, provide you with information or
                    advertising
                    relating to our products or services.

                <div style={style.paragraph2}>
                    We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for
                    potential risk and fraud (in
                    particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by
                    generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the
                    success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).

                <div style={style.subtitle}>SHARING YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</div>
                <div style={style.paragraph2}>
                    We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your

                    Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with
                    applicable laws and regulations,
                    to
