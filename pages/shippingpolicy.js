                    If you have entered the wrong shipping address into your order, and your
                    order has been placed,
                    please contact our staff immediately at support@hadesactive.com. Our staff ships out items within 48

                    Our warehouse is based in Utah. Orders take 1-2 business days to process
                    before they are shipped.
                    Youâ€™ll receive a shipping confirmation email that includes your tracking number once your order has
                    left our warehouse. Please note that changes to your order (size, colour, address) cannot be made
                    after your order has been confirmed.

                    Please note any order placed after 12 PM MST on Friday or over the weekend will ship out the
                    following Monday. We are unable to process orders on weekends or holidays (our team needs time to
                    recharge too!)

                    All carriers are currently experiencing unprecedented delays due to
                    COVID-19. The increase in
                    e-commerce purchasing + safety restrictions have created an unpredictable shipping industry. We
                    apologize for any delays that you may be experiencing in receiving your package!

                    If you have NOT received your package within 30 days of your order shipping or your tracking number
                    shows no movement for over 14 days, please contact us at <strong>support@hadesactive.com</strong>.

                    We know, this isn't ideal. We're working with our shipping partners to improve this as best we
                    can!
